    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Mani Suriya from Chennai, India, and I’m currently studying at Singapore Management University.
  I switched from engineering to finance after reading The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham — it felt like a 2x2 hit on the head!
  My dad started different businesses, but many Failed because of leverage. Watching that growing up had a big impact on me. Our Freamework
  is simple every investvent that we make should'nt require to use financial calculator/Excel to do the mat it should be 'NO BRAINER', 'CHEAP' 
  and 'PROTECTED BY MOAT'.
